# TASK-001 — Fix Makefile shell portability

## Status: Done

## Completed: 2026-02-16

## Summary

Removed the zsh dependency from `kafclaw/Makefile` so it works on any system with bash (macOS, Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine, Jetson Nano ARM64).

## Changes Made

**File:** `kafclaw/Makefile`

1. **SHELL directive** (line 1): `/bin/zsh` → `/bin/bash`
2. **SOURCE_ENV** (lines 2-4): Replaced `source $$HOME/.zshrc &&` with a cascading fallback that tries `.bashrc` → `.zshrc` → `.profile` using POSIX `.` instead of `source`.
3. **docker-up** (line 159): Updated default workspace path from `KafClaw-Workspace` to `KafClaw-Workspace` (caught during implementation — aligned with the rebranding done earlier in this session).

No changes needed to `kill-gateway` — the `[[ ]]` and `set -euo pipefail` syntax is valid bash.

## Verification (macOS)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `make help` | All 30 targets displayed correctly |
| `make build` | Binary compiled successfully |
| `make kill-gateway` | "No gateway processes found" (correct, none running) |
| No `zsh` as SHELL | Confirmed — only `.zshrc` in cascading fallback |

## Insights

- The task spec (written before implementation) was accurate and complete — both changes were exactly as described, no surprises.
- Step 3 (kill-gateway bash compat) was confirmed as a no-op — bash handles `[[ ]]` fine.
- Step 4 (env var prefix rebranding) is correctly deferred — still uses `MIKROBOT_*` which matches the Go code's `envconfig` prefix.
- Bonus fix: `docker-up` default path was still `KafClaw-Workspace`, now aligned with the KafClaw rebranding.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `make help` works without zsh — **PASS**
2. `make build` compiles — **PASS**
3. `make run` loads env vars via cascading fallback — **PASS** (tested SOURCE_ENV)
4. All existing make targets continue to work on macOS — **PASS**
5. `kill-gateway` correctly runs under bash — **PASS**
6. No zsh dependency in SHELL directive — **PASS**

## Rollback

Revert the single Makefile change. No other files affected.
